                <p> I am a first-year PhD student at Saarland University and the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology/ee-team" target="_blank">German Research Center for AI (DFKI)</a>. My research focuses on interpretability and efficiency in multilingual language models, supervised by <a href="https://simonost.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Dr. Simon Ostermann</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/genabith/van-genabith/cv.html" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Josef van Genabith</a>. 
                    For an overview of my work, see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RdtNN0kAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar profile</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I completed my Master’s degree in <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html" target="_blank">Language Science and Technology</a> at Saarland University, supported by the <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/" target="_blank">DAAD</a> and Erasmus+ scholarships. As part of my master's studies, I also spent a semester at the Center for Mind and Brain Sciences at the University of Trento (Italy).  
                    During this time, I worked as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology/ee-team" target="_blank">Multilingual Language Technology Lab</a> at DFKI, collaborating closely with my current supervisors.

                <p>
                    Before moving to Germany, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Pedagogy at <a href="http://spsu.ru/" target="_blank">Shevchenko Transnistrian State University</a> (Transnistria). As part of my undergraduate studies, I completed an exchange semester at <a href="https://www.murraystate.edu/" target="_blank">Murray State University</a> (USA) through the fully funded <a href="https://www.worldlearning.org/program/global-undergraduate-exchange-program/" target="_blank">Global UGRAD</a> program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My early fascination with the intersection of mathematics, technology, and language naturally steered me toward Artificial Intelligence and later to Natural Language Processing. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited to continue exploring the inner workings of multilingual models and contributing to their development.
