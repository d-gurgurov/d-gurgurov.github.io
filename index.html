                <h2>about</h2>
                <p>I am a M.Sc. student in the department of <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html" target="_blank">Language Science and Technology</a> at Saarland University (Germany). Currently, I am also an Erasmus exchnage student at Trento University (Italy) at the Center for Mind and Brain Sciences.  
                    Besides, I am working as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology/ee-team" target="_blank">Multilingual Language Technology Lab</a> at German Research Center for AI (DFKI)
                    under the supervision of <a href="https://simonost.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Dr. Simon Ostermann</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/genabith/van-genabith/cv.html" target="_blank">Dr. Prof. Josef van Genabith</a>.
                </p>
                <p>I received my Bachelor's in Linguistics and Pedagogy at <a href="http://spsu.ru/" target="_blank">Shevchenko Transnistrian State University</a> (Transnistria),
                    and did an exchange semester at <a href="https://www.murraystate.edu/" target="_blank">Murray State University</a> (United States) through the <a href="https://www.worldlearning.org/program/global-undergraduate-exchange-program/" target="_blank">Global UGRAD</a> scholarship, a fully-funded American fellowship program.
                    Currently, I am pursuing my Master's with the support of <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/" target="_blank">German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</a> scholarship, one of the top scholarhips offered by the European Union, and partly Erasmus+ scholarship, EU program supporting international education.
                </p>
                <p>During my undergrad in Linguistics, I explored the connections between Mathematics, Technology, and Languages. This led me to dive into Artificial Intelligence, specifically focusing on Natural Language Processing. Despite the challenges, I've gained valuable skills through classes, online courses, and work experience in education, management, and research. 
                It has been a challenging but wonderful journey so far, and I am excited to apply my knowledge and experience to AI research.
